 -v      : Version
 -r PATH : Run script

Long options:
 --help     : Help
 --version  : Version

	* CMake (example given)
	* Astyle
	* Vim (vimcast)
	* https://cdecl.org/
	* #if defined TEST_TOBIN - conditional main file included for test - try this technique when making libraries
	* uuid generation of header guard identifiers
	* #if defined __cplusplus in c files
